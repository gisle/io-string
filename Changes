   Release 1.03

   Seek will not reset the input_line_number (aka $.) for the IO::String
   object any more.

   Workaround for core dump in close() in perl-5.6.x.



2002-12-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

   Release 1.02

   Complemented the tiehandle interface with SEEK/TELL/EOF/BINMODE.

   Make close($io) untie the object.  This make it possible
   to avoid memory leaks in perl-5.8 which seems to have problems
   with self-ties.  Based on patch by Eric Kolve <ekolve@attbi.com>.



2000-01-28   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 1.01

   The eof() method had opposite logic.  Bug spotted by
   Daniel Gruhl <dgruhl@almaden.ibm.com>



1999-04-12   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

   Release 1.00

   Perl version 5.005_03 or better is now needed, because that
   perl has Chip's no-memory-leak-on-self-tie-patch.

   Documentation update
