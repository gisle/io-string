IO::String is a IO::File (and IO::Handle) compatible class that read
or write data from in-core strings.  It is really just a
simplification of what I needed from Eryq's IO-stringy modules.  As
such IO::String is a replacement for IO::Scalar.

This module requires perl5.005 to work.  I also recommend that you
have Chip's no-memory-leak-on-self-tie patch, which I hope will be in
perl5.005_03 when it arrives.  Installation otherwise as usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Documentation is embedded in the module.
